# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

@mui/material

The Bystore component is a React-based UI element designed to visualize and analyze forecasted sales data at the store level. It leverages Chart.js for creating interactive bar charts and allows users to explore sales quantities across different stores and months. The component is part of a larger system for forecasting and analyzing sales data.

Component Structure
The component is structured as a functional React component, utilizing functional components, hooks, and Redux for state management. It consists of several key sections:

Data Fetching and Initialization:

The component uses the useEffect hook to dispatch an asynchronous action to fetch forecasted sales data from the server.
The fetched data is stored in the component's local state variables, including data, loading, and error.
Data Grouping and Summation:

The originalData fetched from the server is transformed and grouped based on store names and months.
The grouped data is stored in the groupedData state variable for further analysis and rendering.
Total Quantity Calculation:

The component calculates the total quantity of forecasted sales for each month, aggregating data from all stores.
The results are stored in the totalQuantityByMonth state variable.
Rendering Total Amounts:

The component renders a section displaying the total forecasted sales quantity for each month.
Chart Rendering and Interaction:

The main visualization is a bar chart using the react-chartjs-2 library.
Users can interact with the chart, and clicking on a bar triggers the handleClick function, allowing for drill-down functionality.
Sorting Functionality:

The component provides a "Sort" button that enables users to sort the data based on sales quantity.
The handleSortClick function is triggered on button click, updating the state to reflect the sorted data.
Drill-Down to Department:

If a user clicks on a bar in the chart, the handleClick function is invoked.
This function sets the storeNameValue and monthValue state variables, triggering a condition to render the ByDepartment component.
Conditional Rendering:

The component uses conditional rendering to switch between the main bar chart view and the detailed view (ByDepartment component) based on the condition state variable.
Usage
To use the Bystore component, integrate it into the parent component or page where sales data analysis is required. Ensure that Redux is set up for state management, and the necessary actions and selectors are available.

jsx
Copy code
import Bystore from 'path/to/Bystore';

// ... (parent component logic)

const ParentComponent = () => {
  // ... (parent component logic)

  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... (other components or content) */}
      <Bystore />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
Props
The Bystore component does not accept any props as it primarily relies on Redux for state management. It fetches the necessary data and handles interactions internally.
